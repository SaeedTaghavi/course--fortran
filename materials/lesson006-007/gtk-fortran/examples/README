GTK FORTRAN Example Programs
============================

This directory contains a number of example programs for the GTK3
version of gtk-fortran.

Any example may be built on a system with gtk-3-fortran installed with
the command:

gfortran <name>.f90 -o <name> `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk-3-fortran`

Examples that use the "high-level" interface have the prefix "hl_".
