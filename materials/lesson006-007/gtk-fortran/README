This branch uses GTK+ 3.

The gtk-fortran project aims to offer scientists programming in Fortran a cross-platform library to build Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Gtk-fortran is a partial GTK+ / Fortran binding 100% written in Fortran, thanks to the ISO_C_BINDING module for interoperability between C and Fortran, which is a part of the Fortran 2003 standard.

To install gtk-fortran, please follow the instructions in the INSTALL file. More informations are available on the project wiki:
